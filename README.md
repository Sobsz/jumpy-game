# jumpy game

it will eventually be a game where you jumpy

## how gaming

- wasd to move
- space to jump
- shift to go slow and also reduce inertia
- comma and period to rotate left and right 45° (like in roblox)
- r to restart

## comparison

aka what to play while waiting for me to finish this

underlined are aspects i personally care about

honorable mention: [neverball](https://neverball.org/) which isn't really a standard platformer but has similar vibes outside of that (and is also quite fun)

also [seum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457210/SEUM_Speedrunners_from_Hell) which i haven't tried yet but it seems cool

## todo

- [x] basic movement
	- [ ] linear acceleration as an option (or replacing exponential?)
	- [x] sneak
		- [ ] crawl
	- [ ] celeste dash?
	- [ ] celeste [coyote time](https://gamerant.com/celeste-coyote-time-mechanic-platforming-impact-hidden-mechanics/) (allow jumps right after falling off a platform)
	- [ ] minecraft [stepping](https://www.mcpk.wiki/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Stepping)?
	- [ ] sonic continuous acceleration (specifically separate from inertia)
	- [ ] variable-height jumps?
	- [ ] finetune it to make sure it's good and comfy; might not matter because roblox obbies are fun despite lack thereof
- [ ] mouse rotation
- [x] 45° snap rotation
	- [ ] make camera follow it smoothly
- [ ] toggle between 1st- and 3rd-person
- [ ] make 3rd-person camera either collide with walls or semitransparently render any that are in the way
- [ ] shadow directly below player
- [ ] slightly fancier model (procedural with adjustable size)
	- [ ] animated
	- [ ] minecraft skin import
- [x] a barebones level
- [ ] custom cube+collider object
	- [ ] other shapes (slope, cylinder?)
	- [ ] fixed-width borders (blender `inset faces` with different material)
- [ ] cube types
	- [ ] winbricks (or should it be winzones?)
	- [ ] killbricks
	- [ ] speedbricks
	- [ ] fallbricks?
	- [ ] slipbricks
	- [ ] celeste rhythmbricks
		- [ ] to the rhythm of smoothly looping music (idk if stock or make own)
	- [ ] climbbricks
	- [ ] movebricks?
	- [ ] buttonbricks??
	- [ ] launchbricks?
	- [ ] checkpointbricks (full reset would require going into a menu i guess, or resetting at a checkpoint)
- [ ] a complete level
	- [ ] a level someone actively enjoys
	- [ ] one level for each mechanic
	- [ ] a full default level set (let's say 36 with a nice difficulty curve)
	- [ ] a kaizo level
	- [ ] someone else making a level
- [ ] level editor
	- [ ] custom music loading (non-trivial due to godot limitations, might need to import a non-unlicense module)
		- [ ] show music title when loading level (automatically solves attribution of potential cc-by music in gameplay videos)
	- [ ] random generation
	- [ ] level server
		- [ ] global leaderboard
- [ ] pause menu
- [ ] level select screen
	- [ ] level unlocking? (i'm thinking only the first `n` uncompleted levels would be available, effectively allowing for `n` skips that can be restored later)
- [ ] sound effects
- [ ] savefile
	- [ ] best time and attempt count
	- [ ] settings
		- [ ] controls
		- [ ] visuals
- [ ] countdown
	- [ ] maybe fly around the level before playing it? kinda like mario odyssey
- [ ] cheats screen
- [ ] credits screen

### unplanned

- custom level format - godot editor is good enough, and if people wanna make ports then a converter can be rigged up
- elo system for level difficulty (like in lichess puzzles, failure = 1/`n`th of a loss, with maybe multiple scores for varying `n`s) - there aren't gonna be enough players for that to work well, and it might encourage sticking to easy unfun levels
- paid content - i generally post everything for free (in part because i don't put much effort into it); if you wanna pay then  buy one of [the games above](#comparison) or [donate](https://liberapay.com/hecko/)
